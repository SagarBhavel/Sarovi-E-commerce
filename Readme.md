# Project Structure

## app
This directory contains the main application code organized into different modules such as controllers, models, routes, and views.

### controllers
This folder holds files that contain controller functions responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and sending responses back to clients.

### models
This folder contains files defining Mongoose models for MongoDB, representing different data entities such as users, products, and orders.

### routes
This folder contains files that define the routing logic for the application, mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller functions.

### views
This folder contains files written in EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating language, representing the UI (user interface) of the application.

## public
This directory contains static assets such as CSS files and client-side JavaScript files that are served to the client-side browser.

### css
This folder contains CSS files responsible for styling the HTML elements in the views.

### js
This folder contains JavaScript files that are executed on the client-side browser, providing interactivity and dynamic behavior to the UI.

## server.js
This is the main entry point of the Node.js application. It contains the code to configure and start the Express.js server.

## config
This directory contains configuration files for the application.

### database.js
This file typically contains the configuration and connection logic for the database (e.g., MongoDB) used by the application.

## middleware
This directory contains middleware functions that can be used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

### authMiddleware.js
This file contains middleware functions responsible for authenticating users and protecting routes that require authentication.

### errorMiddleware.js
This file contains middleware functions for handling errors that occur during the request-response cycle and sending appropriate error responses to clients.

## utils
This directory contains utility/helper functions that can be used across different parts of the application.

### helper.js
This file contains various utility functions that assist in common tasks such as formatting data, validation, and other miscellaneous tasks.

## resources
This directory contains modules responsible for handling RESTful API resources.

### users.js
This file defines routes and controller functions for managing user resources in the RESTful API.

### products.js
This file defines routes and controller functions for managing product resources in the RESTful API.

### orders.js
This file defines routes and controller functions for managing order resources in the RESTful API.

## node_modules
This directory contains all the installed Node.js packages and dependencies of the application.

## package.json
This file contains metadata about the Node.js application and its dependencies. It also defines scripts for various tasks such as starting the server, running tests, etc.
